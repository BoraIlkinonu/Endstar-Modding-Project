1. What is Endstar Engine?


Endstar Engine is a block based engine made in unity, catered towards those who want to get into game development and does not have sufficient programming or developing skills in games. The engine is made in unity and is similar to Minecraft and Roblox. Users can choose assets that already exist in the asset library within the engine. All they have to do is drag and drop and start connecting the different assets to create new game mechanics.
2. How to download Endstar Engine


3. Endstar Engine Menu UI
   * Create/Play Tab
      * In the create section of this tab, users can start creating their own games.
      * In the play section of the tab, users can play games published by other users.
   * Party Tab
      * Users can add up to 3 teammates in the party tab (Total of 4 members in a party). Click on the + icon to add friends, and then type in your friends username. Clicking on the gear wheel icon allows you to change the avatar for your character. Press the ESC button to go back to the Menu.
   * Options Tab
      * You can adjust graphical settings and resolution in this tab. If your PC/Laptop/Macbook is not able to run Endstar smoothly, you can reduce the quality of the game to get better performance. Lowering the resolution to a lower number would increase performance at the cost of visual clarity (visuals become blurrier the lower the resolution number is). You can also choose preset graphics (Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High, Ultra) or choose Custom graphical options.

2. Tileset Menu
      * Clicking on this tool, or by clicking its designated keyboard shortcut on the keyboard (designated keyboard shortcut is 2), opens up the tileset menu. The Tileset Menu is a core component of the editor, providing users with access to a library of pre-defined tiles that can be used to design and build levels or environments. It allows for efficient and intuitive placement of tiles, enabling users to construct intricate layouts with precision. You can add more tilesets to your library by clicking the + button at the top of the menu.
3. Props Menu
      * The Props Tool allows users to access the Props Menu, by selecting the tool directly or using its designated keyboard shortcut (designated keyboard shortcut is 3). This menu offers a wide range of assets that can be placed within the game environment to enhance interactivity and visual appeal. These assets include:
      * Collectibles: Items like coins or keys that players can gather.
      * Rule Blocks: Elements that define game logic or conditions within a level.
      * Environment Interactables: Objects that players can interact with, such as levers, switches, or doors.
      * NPCs (Non-Player Characters): Characters that populate the environment, including allies, enemies, or neutral figures.
      * Furniture and Decorations: Items like chairs, tables, or ornamental pieces to enhance the setting.
      * Natural Elements: Trees, rocks, boulders, and other terrain features that contribute to the environment aesthetics.
      * Weapons and Tools: Items that players can use or equip to achieve objectives.
      * Level Gates: Portals or transitions that guide players to the next level.
      * Traps and Hazards: Obstacles or dangers that challenge players and add complexity to gameplay.
      * Usables: Items like health packs, potions, or temporary power-ups that provide benefits during play.

         * Props - Toggle this to remove props
         * Include Wired Props - Toggle this to remove any props that are wired to another prop. This is turned off by default.
5. Wiring Tool
      * The Wiring Tool is used to define and establish game logic by creating connections between props. It is the blue cable icon (designated keyboard shortcut is 5) By selecting this tool and interacting with two props, users can open the Wiring Menu, where they can configure triggers and outputs to build dynamic interactions.
         * Step 1: Click on the first prop to designate it as the trigger. This represents the initiating event (e.g., a lever being pulled).
         * Step 2: Click on the second prop to designate it as the output. This represents the resulting action (e.g., a door opening).
         * Step 3: In the Wiring Menu, specify the trigger event (e.g., "lever pulled") and map it to the desired output event (e.g., "door opens").
6. Inspector Tool
      * The inspector tool is the yellow icon with the magnifying glass logo (designated keyboard shortcut is 6).
7. Copy/paste Tool
      * The copy and paste tool (designated keyboard shortcut is 7) allows you to copy props (but not tiles). If you copy and paste a prop that is wired to another prop, the copied prop will also carry the same wiring and same settings of the original prop. 
8. Move/Reposition Tool
      * The move tool (designated keyboard shortcut is 8) allows you to move and rotate props (but not tiles) in your game world. To rotate props, click and hold the left mouse button on the prop and drag your mouse to rotate the prop.


8. Props


Endstar has a variety of props you can find from the props library and even more props from the extended library which you can find by clicking on the + icon at the top of the prop library. The props in Endstar allow you to create your own mechanics, systems, rules, and aesthetics of your game world.


There are different kinds of props, but can be classified into 3.


* Rule Blocks or Nodes - A rule block is a visual logic component that defines a condition and an outcome — basically, "if this happens, then do that." These are colored blocks with icons on them.
* Dynamic props - Props like doors, levers, turrets, collectibles, etc that the user can interact with, and will bring a change in the game world.
* Static props - Props like trees, vegetation, rocks, boulders, furniture, etc that offer no interaction, but will improve the aesthetics of your game world.

The dialogue will pop up when conditions are met (e.g., When a player enters trigger volume area in front of NPC, the trigger volume triggers the text bubble bark block, initiation dialogue from NPC).

                                                               * Portal

                                                                  * Randomly picks one or more outputs to trigger. Adds unpredictability to level design.
